Clannad_VN_Flowcharts

This project is to create 100% absolute correct flowcharts of the Clannad Visual Novel (and Tomoyo After)

I am using Graphviz's "Dot" to make my graphs.
http://www.graphviz.org/

Currently, Clannad's graphs are in seperate graphs, but once completed, will be combined.  (Its easier to work on them this way...)
Tomoyo After will remain a seperate graph, as it is a seperate game.

I welcome collaboration... (it's a lot of work!)


I am creating these graphs by plaing the games myself, and from multiple sources of information scattered around the Internet.  Sources are located below...


=====
I suggest viewing "Clannad_VN_Flowchart_AfterStory.jpg" to get a feel of the results, as it is the most complete.

Status:
Clannad's School Life has much work to be done.
Clannad's Afterstory is functionally complete, though more detail could be added.
Doki Doki High School minigame is complete.
Tomoyo After is partially completed.

A big thanks to Google Translate for translating Japanese to English for me... Although it doesn't translate very well...
